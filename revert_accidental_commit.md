If some files got accidentally synced to GitHub, you can undo this in a few simple steps. Here’s how you can revert those changes:

### 1. **Revert the Commit Locally**
   You’ll first need to go back to the state before the unwanted files were committed. Run these commands in the terminal inside VS Code or your Git Bash:

   ```bash
   # Undo the last commit but keep changes unstaged
   git reset HEAD~1
   ```

   This command moves the commit history back by one commit without deleting the changes from your local workspace.

### 2. **Remove the Unwanted Files**
   You can now selectively stage files or modify `.gitignore` if needed. If certain files shouldn’t be committed, either remove them or add them to `.gitignore`. I prefer this.

   - To remove specific files from staging:
     ```bash
     git restore --staged path/to/file
     ```

   - If you want to remove them entirely from your working directory:
     ```bash
     rm path/to/file
     ```

### 3. **Commit and Push the Correct Changes**
   After making the necessary changes, you can commit the correct files and push again:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix accidental sync"
   git push --force origin <branch-name>
   ```

   **Note**: The `--force` option will overwrite the last commit on GitHub with your corrected version.
